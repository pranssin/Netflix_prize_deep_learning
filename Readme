The code contained is the majority required to run and generate the results for our project. In order
to run our code you must have Python 3.5 or 3.6 installed.  We recommend installing Anaconda (64-bit)
as this will have the majority of the packages required to run our program.  Anaconda download can be
found here:
https://anaconda.org/

The following additional packages are required to be installed and are not included as part of the
Anaconda Python environment:
* psycopg2
* Keras
* Tensorflow

psycopg2 can be installed easily in the Anaconda environment by using the following command in an
Anaconda terminal:
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2

Next, Keras must be installed with the Tensorflow backend.  Instructions for installing keras can be
found here:
https://keras.io/

Instructions for Tensorflow can be found on that same documentation page with Keras as well.
However, if additional help is required, you can go here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
